Helllo! my name is Reyes, yes I'm looking for a job in this field. Here is a vew of my Github Repository:

- BoomBox_BoomMapper: This is a fork with small changes. At first, I forked it to fix an issue with bpm changes.

- Growth-Bullet-Hell: This is a unity game I started with a friend for a game jam, but we got busy, so we never submitted. I sometimes add to the project, but for now it's just shelved.

- JameGamUmU: This is a godot game made for a 6 day game jam I made with friends.
