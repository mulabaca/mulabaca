Helllo! my name is Reyes, and I'm new to the coding scene. I find all this stuff cool and would love to start doing actuall content. 
I've had github for two years, but I made the account to download a beatsaber mod. It's been unactive since then, as I was too intimidated by code I couldn't understand. 

I love videogames and look forward to new tech like, future vr headsets and curious about brain interfacing.

I'm currently learning Java and C. I've learned quite a bit of python, and feel comfortable learning new lenguages. 

I hope to eventually colaborate with people on cool stuff like mods, games or even get a job. The last one seems far as my repository is empty at the moment. 

You can reach me at my discord Reyes#5495 for now.
