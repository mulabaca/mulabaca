Helllo! my name is Reyes, yes I'm looking for a job in this field. Here is a vew of my Github Repository:

- BoomBox_BoomMapper: This is a fork with small changes. At first, I forked it to fix an issue with bpm changes.

- Growth-Bullet-Hell: This is a unity game I started with a friend for a game jam, but we got busy, so we never submitted. I sometimes add to the project, but for now it's just shelved.

- JameGamUmU: This is a godot game made for a 6 day game jam I made with friends.

- CMPT-370-Project: Is a project I worked on with a classmate for Introduction to Computer Graphics course at MacEwan. readMe includes a video demo.
  
Other repositories that are private include a discord bot, and other university projects.
Here is a video of one of them. Me and my group had to make a fake commercial for the app we made in Introduction to software Engeneering: https://youtu.be/6x7wnf0auv4
